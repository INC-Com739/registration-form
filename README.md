# Registration Form

Build the Registration Form (index.html)
Your form must include:

First & Last Name (text inputs)
Email (email input)
Password (minlength 6, required)
Birthdate (date input)
Interests (checkboxes)
Submit Button

Style the Form with CSS
After building the form, style it to make it visually appealing.
Do not rely on default browser styles. Use CSS to create custom styling for form elements such as input fields, buttons, labels, and layout.

Things to focus on:

Use Flexbox or Grid for layout if necessary.
Style the input fields (padding, borders, and focus states).
Style the submit button with hover effects.
Ensure the form is responsive and looks good on both small and large screens.

Add JavaScript (script.js)
Prevent form submission from refreshing the page.
Capture and display the input values inside a <div id="output"></div>.
